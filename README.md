About Data : 

16980 - Research papers - rawdata.csv
5551  - Users           - user-info.csv
204986- Biblographic Entries  - not sure where!!

Each user has list of all papers in his library in userinfo.csv, 
Against the user id in userinof.csv , there are the line numbers of the reserach papers that they have in their library. How do we know that, 
we studied the user.dat file and this hypothesis is found true for one user, (so I shall update on how many users I tried this!)
